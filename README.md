# interpretable-ML

Interactive JsPsyh for interpretable ML projects (work in progress).

There are three custom plugins which most of the functionalities consist of: 

  * jspsych-clickable-box.js
  * jspsych-dual-clickable-box.js
  * jspsych-ml-flowchart.js

Open `experiment.html` in browser (tested in Chrome) to run the experiment.
